- [Live Site: ](https://somecallmejosh-rest-maps.netlify.app/)

## Project specs
1. Build layout in accordance with Figma design files.
  - See all countries from the API on the homepage
  - Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
  - Click through to the border countries on the detail page
1. Allow for API based search and filter functionality.
  - Use https://restcountries.com/#rest-countries API to display lists of countries, and country data.
  - Search for a country using an `input` field
  - Filter countries by region
1. Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*
